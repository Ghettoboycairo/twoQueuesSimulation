Problem Formulation:
The problem involves modeling a supermarket checkout area with two cashiers—express and regular—serving customers with different characteristics. The goal is to estimate various system performance measures using a discrete event simulation approach. This includes average service time, average waiting time, queue lengths, probabilities, and idle times for both types of customers. Additionally, the impact of changing the percentage of express and regular customers on the system is explored.

Objectives:
    1. Estimate the average service time for express and regular customers.
    2. Calculate the average waiting time in the express and regular cashier queues.
    3. Determine the maximum queue lengths for both cashiers.
    4. Find the probability that a customer waits in the express cashier queue.
    5. Calculate the portion of idle time for both cashiers.
    6. Compare theoretical and experimental average service times and inter-arrival times.
    7. Analyze the system's sensitivity to different percentages of express and regular customers.

Conclusion:
In summary, the discrete event simulation of the supermarket checkout area provided insightful results and practical implications for supermarket management. Key findings include accurate estimation of average service time, waiting time, and queue lengths for express and regular customers. The validation of theoretical expectations against experimental results enhances the reliability of the simulation model. The system demonstrated sensitivity to changes in customer percentages, offering valuable flexibility for operational adjustments. Analysis of cashier idle times identified opportunities for resource optimization. The simulation results empower decision-makers with actionable insights for improving customer service and resource allocation. Looking ahead, the model can be further enhanced to incorporate additional factors, ensuring its continued relevance in addressing evolving supermarket scenarios. Overall, the simulation serves as a powerful tool for understanding, optimizing, and making informed decisions regarding supermarket checkout operations.
